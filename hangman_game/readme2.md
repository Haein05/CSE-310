## Overview

**Project Title**: Hangman Game

**Project Description**: The Hangman Game project is a console-based application developed in C++ using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It aims to create a fun and interactive word-guessing game where players guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The project will implement fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, and basic file I/O operations.

**Project Goals**: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and edge cases. Gain practical experience in developing a complete application from scratch, enhancing problem-solving and debugging skills.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Required Software - Ensure I have C++ installed on my system.
2. Install the C++ extension for VS Code from the Extensions Marketplace to enable C++ development features.
3. After successfully building the project, run the executable file generated by the compiler

Instructions for using the software:

1. The game will show the hidden word as a series of underscores (\_) representing each letter of the word.
2. Type a single letter and press Enter.
3. After winning or losing, you will be prompted to play again. Enter 'Y' to play another round or 'N' to exit the game.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) version 1.60.0 or later
- C/C++ Extension by Microsoft version 1.5.1 or later
- Open VS Code and select File > Open Folder... to open the project directory.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ Improve Error Handling ] Enhance the error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected inputs and edge cases more effectively.
- [ Add a Hint System ] Implement a hint system that provides clues to players when they are stuck.
- [ Add Difficulty Levels ] Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to challenge players of varying skill levels.
